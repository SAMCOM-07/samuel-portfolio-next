              My journey into tech began with a deep curiosity about how technology shapes the modern world. I&#39;ve always been fascinated by how a simple idea could evolve into something people use every day. This curiosity led me to explore website development, starting first with WordPress, where I built small websites and blogs for clients and personal practice.

            <span className="text-muted-foreground font-medium leading-6">
              As my interest grew, I transitioned into more advanced technologies, learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and later moving into React and Next.js. These frameworks opened up endless possibilities for me â€” from building static pages to developing full-scale, interactive web applications.
            </span>
            <span className="text-muted-foreground font-medium leading-6">
              Over time, I&#39;ve worked on multiple real-world and personal projects, each one improving my understanding of design systems, UI/UX, responsive layouts, accessibility, and code optimization. I&#39;ve also developed strong skills in collaboration, version control (Git/GitHub), and project deployment using platforms like Vercel and Netlify.
            </span>
            <span className="text-muted-foreground font-medium leading-6">
              My tech journey is still ongoing, and I&#39;m excited about the endless opportunities in software development, especially in building tools that help businesses and individuals succeed online.
