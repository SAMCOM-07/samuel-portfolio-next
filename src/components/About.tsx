              My development philosophy revolves around building solutions that are user-centered, scalable, and performance-driven. I believe that every website should not only look great but also serve a purpose â€” whether that&#39;s helping a brand grow, improving user engagement, or simplifying processes through technology.

                My journey into tech began with a deep curiosity about how
                technology shapes the modern world. I&#39;ve always been
                fascinated by how a simple idea could evolve into something
                people use every day. This curiosity led me to explore website
                development, starting first with WordPress, where I built small
                websites and blogs for clients and personal practice.

                className="text-muted-foreground font-medium leading-6"
              >
                As my interest grew, I transitioned into more advanced
                technologies, learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and later
                moving into React and Next.js. These frameworks opened up
                endless possibilities for me â€” from building static pages to
                developing full-scale, interactive web applications.

                className="text-muted-foreground font-medium leading-6"
              >
                Over time, I&#39;ve worked on multiple real-world and personal
                projects, each one improving my understanding of design systems,
                UI/UX, responsive layouts, accessibility, and code optimization.
                I&#39;ve also developed strong skills in collaboration, version
                control (Git/GitHub), and project deployment using platforms
                like Vercel and Netlify.

                My tech journey is still ongoing, and I&#39;m excited about the

                online.

                My mission as a developer goes beyond just writing code â€” it&#39;s
                about creating meaningful solutions that have real impact. I aim
                to grow into a well-rounded Software Developer with expertise in
                both frontend and backend technologies, capable of building
                complete systems and leading innovative projects.

                I envision myself working in collaborative startup environments
                and cooperative organizations, where ideas are shared freely,
                creativity is encouraged, and growth is constant. I also plan to
                build and manage my own startup, focusing on developing tools,
                platforms, or services that simplify lives and empower others
                through technology.

                In the long run, I want to be recognized not just for technical
                skills, but for problem-solving, creativity, and leadership. My
                journey is driven by passion, purpose, and the desire to make
                technology a force for good in every project I touch.
